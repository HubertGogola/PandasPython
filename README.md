# âš½ Football Stats Analysis (Polish Ekstraklasa) â€“ ONLY with Pandas

This project analyzes football match data from the Polish Ekstraklasa **using only the Pandas library** in Python.  
It was created as a self-learning exercise to demonstrate practical skills in data manipulation and exploration without relying on external tools or visualizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Project

- Show that **you can perform full-scale football data analysis using only `pandas`**
- Practice grouping, filtering, merging, and analyzing sports stats in a clean and code-driven way
- Avoid using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `numpy` â€” focus strictly on `pandas`

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- File: `POL.xlsx`
- Source: [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) (or similar)
- Includes: match results, dates, teams, scores, outcomes, and bookmaker odds
- Seasons covered: 2012/2013 â€“ 2024/2025

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed

- âœ… Total goals per team and season
- âœ… Goals scored vs conceded
- âœ… Highest-scoring matches
- âœ… Most and least efficient teams
- âœ… Match results vs bookmaker odds
- âœ… Home vs Away stats
- âœ… Matches grouped by time, season, team

All of this was done **using only core `pandas` operations**, such as:
- `.groupby()`
- `.merge()` / `.join()`
- `.value_counts()`
- `.sort_values()`
- `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`
- `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.max()`, `.idxmax()`

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development only)

## ðŸ™‹ Author

This notebook was created as part of a personal learning challenge to prove fluency in practical pandas usage â€” without help from visualization tools or data science libraries.
